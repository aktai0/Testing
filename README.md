# VS - Lookup Matchups! 

Check matchup data to see which champions had the most favorable lane matchups in URF mode! See highest and lowest win rates overall or for a specific lane matchup, or see which champions were most popular.

This program uses the Match endpoint's Participants.Timeline.Lane property to determine which champions are laning against each other, instead of calculating based on whether two champions are on opposite teams.

##Features

- View champions with the highest or lowest win rates as well as champions with the most popularity.
- Check out lists of a champion's favorable/unfavorable matchups: which enemy laners give lower/higher win rates? Which champions should you choose if you hate laning against a certain champion in URF mode?
- See how well others have done in a lane with a specific champion and specific enemy laner.
